# Richard John Black - Developer Portfolio Site

https://richardjohnblack.netlify.app

The above link will direct you to the current hosted website. This site has been built primarily as an online developer CV, with details and links to my various coding projects as well as information about my career history, my motivations, my personality, and my interests and hobbies outside of coding.

Unlike anything I had built previously, I wanted to build a static website utilising HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to consolidate and expand my understanding of DOM traversal and manipulation, which I had only a very limited amount of experience with prior to starting this project. In that respect, in addition to its professional utility, it has also been a valuable learning exercise that has increased my exposure to this area of software/web development.

In contrast to my previous front-end projects, whilst I was sure to incorporate a responsive design during the building process to ensure it both looked and performed well across the broadest range of display types possible, this site was originally conceived as a traditional website that is optimally viewed on a desktop PC or laptop.


## Future Updates
As my experience as a developer grows so do I hope this site will continue to be updated and grow with me. This will include new projects being added to the portfolio page as well as the design and layout changing to better reflect the content I will have to display.

It's possible I may also use it as a home to write blog posts, as well as increasing the focus on my unofficial second career as a musician and content/media creator, should I branch out to doing that kind of work in any kind of pro/semi-pro capacity. This might include more interactive media content on the site at some point.


## Tech Stack
As a static site, no additional libraries or frameworks were utilised beyond EmailJS to power the contact form. The site was built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to run in all web browsers.
