        <h2 id="about-subheader">A life outside coding</h2>

        <p>
          Outside of coding, I have many interests and hobbies that I enjoy and keep me busy. My main passion
          in life is music, and to that end I have been playing in bands in and
          around Birmingham for over a decade. Primarily I play guitar but I can
          also play brass instruments and have been known to sing from time to
          time too!
        </p>

        <p>
          As well as performing, I also write music and lyrics, whether that be
          for the bands I play with or for my own personal projects. Since 2015
          I have been playing as a lead guitarist for Shaun Gambowl Walsh & The
          Plagiarists. We're very active in putting out all sorts of content
          beyond purely music, and I currently maintain and run a Twitch and
          YouTube channel for us, so I'm always busy doing creative things even
          when I'm not up to my neck in code!
        </p>

          src="./images/innercity.jpg"
          id="gig-poster"
          alt="a poster for Inner City Live 2019"
        />

        <p>
          In 2019 we were lucky enough to share a stage with genuine musical
          royalty in Doves, Johnny Marr, The Coral, and fellow local lads The
          Twang for a 1-day festival held at Perry Park in Birmingham (Inner
          City Live). It was a great experience and hopefully not the last time
          I get to be part of such a huge event with world-class performers and
          artists.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you're interested in finding out more about the music I'm making,
          you can search for us on all the usual streaming services (and maybe
          also check out my previous bands Silvershores and The Lucky 27s whilst
          you're at it!), and all the links to our content and various media
          channels can be found on the links page, so be sure to check them out!

          alt="a team photograph of Birmingham Citadel FC"
        />

        <p>
          Beyond my music, I also enjoy sports (especially football) and was a
          keen amateur footballer, having played 11-a-side competitively since
          the age of 7 for various sides at various levels. Unfortunately, age
          has caught up with me and since 2019 I've been forced to hang up my
          boots, apart from the odd kick about or 5-a-side match with mates.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some of my broader interests include going to gigs, music festivals,
          indie/alternative music club nights, travelling, video games, movies,
          reading (though I don't get round to it anywhere near as much as I'd
          like), collecting vinyl, science, politics and generally soaking up as
          much culture and knowledge as I can!
