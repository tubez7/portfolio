            Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Richard and I'm a Junior
            Developer from Birmingham, currently looking for my first
            professional role as a Junior Software Engineer. This site has been
            built by myself to showcase the projects I have built or
            collaborated on, as well documenting my professional experience and
            a little bit about my hobbies, interests, and life in general
            outside of coding. I might even succumb to the cliche and start
            writing a regular blog on here too!<br /><br />Please have a poke
            around, check out the projects on the portfolio section, and contact
            me with any feedback or comments you might have about anything you
            see on here. I'm always eager to learn as much as I can, and the
            advice and opinions of others is a powerful aid towards progress!

            My journey into coding begins...
          </h2>
          <p>
            After being made redundant from my position as an Account Manager at
            FIS in 2020, where I had worked continuously for almost 10 years, I
            decided to take some time out from working to consider my next
            career move. After looking at what options were available to me and
            potential new career paths, I decided to embark on a new journey in
            software development via the Northcoders fullstack JavaScript
            bootcamp that was being offered for free via the UK Government
            re-skilling programme. As I worked through the learning materials
            required to pass the entry challenge for the course and then
            graduating from the course itself in April 2022, I have found coding
            to be a challenging yet extremely rewarding endeavour and one that I
            am excited to continue in a professional capacity. Although I have
            experience with both frontend and backend development, it's in
            building websites and frontend applications that I especially find
            most enjoyable and inspiring!
            <br />
            <br />
            Since graduating from the Northcoders bootcamp I have continued to
            work towards my goal of becoming a developer and continue to
            practise and develop my skills and hope that this will result in me
            being able to gain my first professional role in the very near
            future!

                programming, agile practices (stand-ups, Kanban boards, retros
                etc), CI/CD, test-driven development, and Functional and

                <h5>Front-end Project - News App</h5>
                <p>
                  I built a mobile first designed front-end architecture that
                  acts as a news app to serve news articles via integration with
                  the back-end project news API. Built using React, CSS HTML5,
                  and Material UI.
                </p>
                <h5>Back-end Project - News API</h5>
                <p>
                  I built a RESTful API to interact with a PostgreSQL database,
                  incorporating MVC programming principles in order to provide
                  data to the front-end news app project. Built with Express and
                  using full TDD incorporating Jest.
                </p>
                <h5>Final Project - Tremolo</h5>
                <p>
                  As part of a team, I created an app that enables musicians to
                  network via geolocation and post classified ads for
                  collaborating. The front-end architecture was built using
                  Svelte, hosted as a Progressive Web Application, and
                  integrated with Firebase for the database and user
                  authentication implementation.
