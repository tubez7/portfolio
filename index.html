            Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Richard and I'm a Junior
            Developer looking for my first professional role as a Junior
            Software Engineer. On this site I hope to showcase the projects I
            have built or collaborated on as well documenting my professional
            experience and a little bit about my life outside of coding.<br /><br />Please
            have a poke around, check out the projects on the portfolio section,
            and contact me with any feedback or comments you might have about
            anything you see on here. I'm always eager to learn as much as I
            can, and the advice and opinions of others is often a powerful tool
            towards progress!
          </p>

            My journey in code begins...
          </h2>
          <p>
            After being made redundant from my position as an Account Manager at
            FIS in 2020, where I had worked continuously for almost 10 years, I
            decided to take some time out from working to consider my next
            career move. After looking at what options were available to me and
            potential new career paths, I decided to embark on a new journey in
            software development via the Northcoders fullstack JavaScript
            bootcamp that was being offered for free via the UK Government
            re-skilling programme. As I worked through the learning materials
            required to pass the entry challenge for the course and then
            graduating from the course itself in April 2022, I have found coding
            to be a challenging yet extremely rewarding endeavour and one that I
            am excited to continue in a professional capacity. Although I have
            experience with both frontend and backend development, it's in
            building websites and frontend applications that I especially find
            most enjoyable and inspiring!
            <br />
            <br />
            Since graduating from the Northcoders bootcamp I have continued to
            work towards my goal of becoming a developer and continue to
            practise and develop my skills and hope that this will result in me
            being able to gain my first professional role in the very near
            future!
